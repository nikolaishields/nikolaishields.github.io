- Evading Montage States : The feeling of productivity without the results
    A post detailing the feeling of what I call a montage state, when you are performing a task/ working on learning about something
    but lose focus and are entranced by the high of the results of your present efforts, only to realise that this lapse of focus has detracted from
    the results you sought in the first place.
    
    - Methods to evade this trap
        - Don't talk about your progress, only completed milestones
        - Its happening, not happened (practice is enticing, and rewarding in its own right, however it is not the inherent goal, remember this)
        - Turn of the good music while working
            Music for productivity can be a double edged sword, sometimes music primes your for productivity, everyone has had those moments 
            when the right tune, at the right volume was selected or played and all of that calculus homework just flew by, effortlessly. 
            However sometimes this effortless focus can feel more gratifying than the rewards of whatever you should be focused on, and when this occurs
            It can create the perfect environment for day-dreaming. To avoid this, you have to be mindful both in your intention, and willing to remove
            stimuli from your environment that is to distracting, especially the stimuli that is more enticing to write off as part of performing your task.
