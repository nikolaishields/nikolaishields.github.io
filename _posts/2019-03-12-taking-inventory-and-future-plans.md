Its been sometime since I've posted here, which I suppose at the end of the day
is a good thing, as I've been occupied with a new job, new hobbies and a new city.
In addition to all of these life events, I've begun working on a number of new
projects, among which has been to retool and refactor my website and the infrastructure
around it. There will be many more posts in the coming days, although this post serves to 
test as a springboard for my publishing workflow.

Now for the inventory:
* vps [1-core, 4GB RAM]
* PN000 [8-core FX-3500(Vishera), 32GB RAM, ZFS mirror]
* PN001 [4-core xeon, 16GB RAM, ZFS with ssd cache]
* PN002 [4-core xeon, 16GB RAM, ZFS with ssd cache]
* PN003 [8-core Cortex-A7, 2GB RAM](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-hc2-home-cloud-two/)
* A healthy amount of Ubiquity equipment (more on this in a later post)

Since starting this job, I've been afforded the opportunity to do a much needed
hardware refresh! All in all I spent less than ~$500, and got a new coffee table!

I was also able to get a much needed new monitor.
Its been just me and my thinkpad for some time, so I decided to splurge and get this 
32" 2k display by Acer. It was on sale at the local microcenter for under $200, so I chalked it up as a win.

In addition to all these goodies, I even recieved a new yubikey from a friend of mine to secure it all!

Thats all for now.
